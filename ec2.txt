General purpose SSD : gp2 / gp3
Provisioned iops SSD : io1 / io2 / io2blockexpress*

Throughput optimized HDD : st1 : 
Cold hdd : sc1 

Magnetic : standard

IOPS : Input and Output Operations per second

root Volume : COntains OS : gp2, gp3, io1, io2 and standard/magnetic
Additional volume : + st1, sc1

General Purpose SSD : (gp2 / gp3) : Low latency interactive applications, Dev and test environment..!!
Min : 1 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 16,000 IOPS
gp2 --> works 1 : 3 ration (1 gb volume = 3 iops), with min of 100..

for gp3, we have an advantage, we can mention/choose required IOPS count.

__

Provisioned iops : (io1 & io2) : workload that requires Specific IOPS count.. or if we need more than 16,000 iops for our ec2 instance.. I/O Intensive database workloads..
Min : 4 GiB, Max: 16 TiB... Max IOPS: 64,000 IOPS
--> It provided highest performance among all. 

io2 Block Express volume : Min : 4 GiB, Max: 64 TiB...
Supports 256,000 IOPS..

** Need to perform OS level operations to make additional volumes available.
--> Disk Management --> diskmgmt.msc --> choose volume --> make it online --> Initilize disk --> SImple volume --> NTFS/FAT --> Create

Windows : FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs


_______

Windows : FAT, FAT32, NTFS, ReFS
Linux : ext3, ext4, xfs

df	: disk filesystem

/dev/xvdf --> 1 gb volume

grab the name of new volume : /dev/xvdb

lsblk		--> List block based devices
df -Th		--> List the available volumes

/dev/xvda1	--> root volume (/)
/dev/xvdf	--> new Volume name 

In windows OS, we mount new volumes to drive letters.. But in Linux OS, We mount volumes to Directory. 

mkdir newvolume

file -s /dev/xvdf  	--> If this command returns with "data", no file system.
			--> If this returns ext3/xfs filesystem.. We have a file system.


mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf		--> Make file system and write it to Additonal volume

mount /dev/xvdf newvolume/	--> mount addl volume to directory

--> Above mount is temp mount only.. it won't available after the instance reboot.
--> To make this volume perm mount to the directory, Add entry in "/etc/fstab" file.
--> Get the entry information from "/etc/mtab" file. 

--> cat /etc/mtab		--> Grab the entry related to newly added addl volume

/dev/xvdb /home/ec2-user/newvolume xfs rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,noquota 0 0

--> vim /etc/fstab.. Write the above entry, save and quit the editor. (Do not edit the existing entry).

mount -all
__________
--> Increase the volume size the "Cosole" first, then execute the below command..!!

We can use "xfsprogs" to increase existing volume size. 

yum install xfsprogs

--> xfs_growfs -d /volume-Mountpoint
--> xfs_growfs -d /home/ec2-user/newvolume

Choose the volume --> Take a Snapshot --> Create a volume from snapshot, while creating choose ap-south-1b --> we'll get volume in 1b --> Attach to Instance 2 running in ap-south-1b

Instance 1 in Mumbai : ap-south-1a ---> Instance 2 in N Virginia : us-east-1a ==> Detach from instance 1 and attach to instance 2 is not possible as both are running in diff regions.. 
Choose the volume --> Take a Snapshot --> Copy the snapshot to desired region (NV) 
--> Create a volume, while creating choose us-east-1a --> volume in 1a --> Attach to Instance 2 running in N Virginia : us-east-1a.
(Data transfer from region to region cost us)


Instance 1 in AWSACC1 : Mumbai : ap-south-1a ---> Instance 2 in AWSACC2 : Mumbai : ap-south-1a ==> Detach from instance 1 and attach to instance 2 is not possible as both are running in diff aws accounts, regions.. 
Choose the volume --> Take a Snapshot --> share the snapshot to another aws account 
--> Create a volume, while creating choose ap-south-1a in acc2

Instance 1 volume need to share with everyone.. --> Create a snapshot --> Share to "Public" -->

** We cannot decrease the size of an EBS volume. Only increase is possible.
EBS VOlumes : Always use EBS volumes only.
Instance store volumes : We really don't use this in real environments.   (NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILTY)
	--> Also called as Ephemeral storages (Temporary storage).
	--> We cannot STOP/Start the instance.
	--> Storage will be delivered from underlying host/physical resources.
	--> If required, we can reboot. We don't loss any data.
	--> If underlying h/w failure happens, we'll loss all the data.

Snapshot : Backup copy of an EBS volume.

SOP : Standard Operational Procedure : 

DLM : Data Lifecycle manager : Automate the snapshot creation process. 
--> We use "tags" to filter the resources. 

Default Retention Values: 
Prod : 14 Days
Non Prod : 7 Days 

Fast snapshot restore : Enable fast snapshot restore to ensure that volumes created from snapshots created by this policy instantly deliver all of their provisioned performance.

--> Snapshots are point-in-time copies.
--> Snapshots stores in S3 platform (Not in your s3).
--> Can we view what data we have inside snapshots..?? NO
--> Snapshot Works with Incremental backup mechanism. 
--> If our volume is Encrypted, Snapshot also Encrypts automaticALLY. 
--> When we are launching a volume from encrypted snapshot, volume also encrypts automatically.
--> We cannot share an Default Master key Encrypted snapshot.
--> If we are using Custom encryption key, we can share snapshot with another aws account, but we need to provide permissions on encryption key also to another aws account.

Target Group : Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets. When you create each listener rule, you specify a target group and conditions. When a rule condition is met, traffic is forwarded to the corresponding target group.

Application ELB : http and https

Application Load balancing algorithm : 
--> Round robin
--> Least outstanding requests

--> We cannot assign a dedicated IP address for our Application ELB.

Network ELB : TCP.. 
--> Flow Hash algorithm.
--> We CAN assign a dedicated IP address for our network ELB.

Application LB Supports path based routing, also supports Microservices.

millions req/sec : NLB

ELB Access Logs : Logging on ELB. Destination is s3.

Task : Practice Network ELB with multiple TGs. (80, 8080, 8888)
_______________________

Task : Launch multiple webservers in Multiple AZs... COnfigure the Classic ELB. 
Task : Practice application ELB / ALB with multiple TGs. (80, 8080, 8888)
--> Make sure you configure Pipeline mechanism between your ec2 instances and ELB.!!


___________________________________________________________

--> Windows instance and trying to connect with putty application..!!!!
Windows : Remote Desktop Application : 3389
Linux : Putty / Openssh : 22

--> GoldenAMI : 
Windows : Launch an ec2 instance (base), IIS/WP/Timezone : Create a GoldenAMI --> Launch new ec2 instance (New instance shuld have all settings you configured on base instance)
--> Make sure you change Administrator password before creating goldenAMI (Windows)

--> ELB is not an ec2 instance, you no need to open port 3389 / 22.
For ELB, you need port 80 / 443 / 8080 / 8888

--> Stopping instances, instead of terminate.. Make sure you terminate all resources.

--> Open for everyone with IPv4.



We dont have session tomorrow..!!! Next session is on Wednesday (i.e; 13/04)

ASG : Auto Scaling Group : 

--> DYnamic (Step/Simple) Load 
--> Scheduled scaling : 
--> Manual : 

1. Create a Golden AMI
2. Create an ELB (Empty LB)
3. Create an ASG
	3.1 Create a Launch configuration / Launch template (WHat settings instance)
	3.2 Configure the ASG (When to scale/ Desired count)


ScaleIN : Remove the instance from ASG
ScaleOut : Add the instances to ASG.

How ASG will choose the instance to terminate if any ScaleIN action triggered..!! 

ASG Termination policy : refer to the image.


t2.micro --> Current configuration.. 
t2.nano..??? How you can do this with 0 downtime..!! 


Create a new launch configuration/template.. Associate this with ASG. Terminate the existing instance.. Now new instance will come with updated launch config settings.
(Set Desired capacity to 2)..!!! 


Task : 
Create an ASG with a V1 Launch config.. Launch with Desired capacity as 2.. Test it.. 

Configure Alarm to set Desired capacity as 1, when cpu utilisation is <10. 

Configure scheduled scaling to set DC as 3 instance at specific time and test it. 

________

1 : Create a Golden AMI
2 : Create a ELB
3 : Create a Launch COnfig
4 : Create an ASG with Fixed (2) and test it
5 : Confiure Scheduled scaling.
6 : Configure Simple scaling (low usage scaling)
7 : Configure Versions for Launch config.
