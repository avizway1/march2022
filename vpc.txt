Host : Device we have with in network.


How many networks we required.?
How many hosts you required in each network.?


Class A : N.H.H.H : 127 Networks, Each network supports 16M hosts. 
Class B : N.N.H.H : 16,000 Networks, Each network supports 65,000 Hosts
Class C : N.N.N.H : 2M Networks, Each network supports 256 Hosts.

N.N.N.H : 
192.168.0.(0-255) : 192.168.0. 1/2/3/4/5 .. 255
192.168.1.(0-255) : 192.168.1. 1/2/3/4/5 .. 255
192.168.2.(0-255) : 192.168.2. 1/2/3/4/5 .. 255

____________

In reguar networks, 2 IPs are reserved.. We cannot use these (First Ip/Network id and last ip/Broadcost ip)
In AWS, AWS Reserves three more IPs.. Total 5 IPs are not usable.. 
--> 2 regular network
--> 2 for DNS servers
--> 1 Future use

192.168.0.0/16

/32		--> 32-32=0	2^0 = 1
/31		--> 32-31=1  2^1 = 2
/30		--> 32-30=2	2^2 = 4

/32		/31		/30		/29		/28		/27		/26		/25		/24	..	/16			/0
2^0		2^1		2^2		2^3		2^4		2^5		2^6		2^7		2^8		2^16		2^32
1		2		4		8		16		32		64		128		256		65536		4M

/24 : Usable IPs : ..??

32-24 = 8 = 2^8 = 256 - 5 = 251 Usable IPs

==> AWS supports Min /28 SUbnet.. Maximum /16 Subnet.

Minimum : 32-28 = 4 ==> 2^4 = 16 IPs - 5 reserved = 11 Usable IPs
Maximum : 32-16 = 16 ==> 2^16 = 65536 - 5 reserved = 65531 Usable IPs

VPC : Virtual Private Cloud : Region specific service.. 
VPC Peering : Enable communication between multiple vpc

CIDR : Classless InterDomain Routing : 
--> How big network we required. 
--> How many instances/ resources, we gonna launch. (predict)

Public Subnet : Internet facing subnet.. :
Private Subnet : Non-Internet facing subnet.. : 

How big VPC we required.?				Ans : /16 (65531 Usable IPs)
How many subnets we required within the VPC..?		Ans : 2
How many public SUbnets required within vpc..?		Ans : 1
How many private SUbnets required within vpc.?		Ans : 1
Are you going to create any subnets in future.?		Ans : Yes (Have some IPs for future use).


SUbnet : ap-south-1a : subnet1 & Subnet 2

Public Subnet : Internet facing.. : ELB, Jump/ Bastian Host.. 
Private Subnet : DBs, Application, Web servers.. 

Step 1 : Create a VPC.
	VPC Name : CustomVPC		VPC CIDR : 192.168.0.0/20

Step 2 : Create Subnets within CustomVPC. 

Name : Public Subnet : ap-south-1a : 192.168.0.0/22
Name : Private SUbnet : ap-south-1b : 192.168.4.0/22

Step 3 : Create an Internet Gateway and associate with CustomVPC.
--> One VPC can contains one IGW.

Step 4 : Create RouteTables and Associate appropriate Subnets, add required routes.

--> PublicRoute : Go to SUbnet Association and choose "Public SUbnet". Navigate to Routes and add a route via IGW. 	 (0.0.0.0/0 --> IGW)

--> PrivateRoute : Go to SUbnet Association and choose "Private SUbnet".

Step 5 (Optional) : Navigate to Subnets, Choose "Public SUbnet", Actions, "Modify auto assign public ip settings", Enable.


JUMP Server / Bastian Host : Is a Dedicated EC2 instance, Runs in CustomVPC PUblicSUbnet and can be used to connect to all the "Private Subnet" ec2 instances.


____________

PublicRoute : We need to associate InternetGateway. 
PrivateRoute without internet : Don't add NAT.
PrivateRoute With Intenet : Create NAT Gateway and add NAT Gateway.

VPC NAT Gateway (NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY): Is designed to provide Internet to private Subnet resources. NAT always runs in custom VPCs public subnet. We need to generate an EIP (Elastic IP). 

Private subnet ec2 instances want to access something from internet / endpoint hosted over the internet / patching purpose it needs internet. 

--> Make sure your edit PrivateRoute, and add an entry with 0.0.0.0/0 via NAT gateway.

____

NAT Instance : Now a days we are not using it.  It is an ec2 instance runs in custom vpcs public subnet, provides internet to private subnet resources.  (TEST IT)

--> We need to takes  care about the Security groups. (Open http and https for everyone)
--> Source/destination check must be disabled.

--> Make sure your edit PrivateRoute, and add an entry with 0.0.0.0/0 via NAT Instance.
___________

Task : Create a VPC with 2 Subnets. (1 Public SUbnets and 1 Private Subnets)
1 Public SUbnets (ap-south-1a)
1 Private SUbnets (ap-south-1b)
___

Task : Create a VPC with 4 Subnets. (2 Public SUbnets and 2 Private Subnets)
2 Public SUbnets (ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b)
2 Private SUbnets (ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b)

Task 2 : draw.io website and design this diagram.
https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&libs=aws4

Task 3 : Launch NAT Instance, and provide internet to Private Subnet resources.
